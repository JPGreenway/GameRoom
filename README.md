# *Game Room*

***Game Room*** is a web application that allows users to create an account and track their video game collections. Users can create "shelves" with a name of their choice (for example, a shelf can be named after a video game system or genre). 

To those shelves, users can add games with various details, including an image of their choice.

## Usage

*Game Room* consists of 3 main sections: **Login / Signup**, the **Room View**, and the **Game View**.

### Login / Signup

Click the *"Create an account"* link to visit the *Signup* page where an account can be created. Once an account is made, the *Login* page can be used to access the *Room View*.

### Room View

 The room view is the main portion of the application. On a fresh account, there are two buttons that can be used to get started. 
1) **New Shelf Button**. Enter a shelf name into the input field (such as a video game console name or genre) and click "New Shelf" to create a shelf. 

2) **Settings Button**. Click the settings button to access a menu that allows you to change the UI color, or logout and return to the Login page.

Once a new shelf is added, two new buttons are available.
1) **Expand Shelf Button**. Click the icon at the top left of a shelf to reveal more options, including an **Edit Shelf** button which allows you to change the shelf name, or the **Delete Shelf** button which allows you to delete the shelf.

2) **Add Game Button**. Click this button to enter the details of a game and add it to the shelf. Once a game is added you can click on it to open the "Game View" page.

### Game View

The game view is where you can see all of the details that were uploaded for a particular game, including a large view of the uploaded image. There are three buttons on this page.

1) **Edit Game Button**. Click this button to enter new details for the currently open game, including the option to upload a different image. Please note that the details entered here will overwrite previously entered details.

2) **Delete Game Button**. Click this button to delete the currently open game and return to the **Room View**. 

3) **Close Game Button**. Click the **X** button at the top right of the **Game View** page to return to the **Room View**.
